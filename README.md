# NavDrawerIssue
Sample repo showing inability to have nav drawer on top of a bottom sheet

## Notes
This project was a file > new > Navigation Drawer Activity with only really one file added for the BottomSheet and then trying to call the bottom sheet from the FAB. The bottom sheet works, but the issue is that you can't pull out the nav drawer while the bottom sheet is visible.
